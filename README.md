# rpiMC
Repository for our server.

The website was first genearated using **WordPress** (and WP static website generator). The website is now being **edited manually**.

## Archived
Archived because the Minecraft server got shut down (it never got popular, was hosted on a slowish vps, the db got corrupted, no motivation to keep it running).
